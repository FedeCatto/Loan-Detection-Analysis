# Loan Approval Prediction with Machine Learning on Imbalanced Data

This project explores the use of Machine Learning techniques to automate and improve the loan approval process, with a particular focus on addressing the challenge of imbalanced datasets. The main goal is to build a reliable predictive model capable of assessing the likelihood of loan repayment.
The dataset used contains 252,000 loan applications, including detailed demographic, financial, employment, and property-related features. Key variables include income, age, work experience, marital status, home and vehicle ownership, profession, city, state, and employment/residence duration. The target variable is binary (Risk_Flag), where 1 indicates a high-risk applicant and 0 indicates a low-risk applicant.
The project followed a standard machine learning pipeline. During data preprocessing, missing values and outliers were addressed, new features were engineered (e.g., Income-to-Age ratio, Employment and Residential Stability), and numerical features were standardized. Categorical variables such as marital status, profession, and property ownership were encoded numerically. Feature selection was performed using correlation analysis to eliminate redundant or irrelevant features.
To manage the class imbalance issue, both oversampling (SMOTE) and undersampling techniques were applied to the training data. Several classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, and XGBoost. Model evaluation was conducted using a 70/30 hold-out split and metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve).
The best results were achieved using an ensemble model that combined two Decision Trees: one trained with undersampling and the other with SMOTE. This approach allowed for the aggregation of predictions to improve accuracy and robustness. The ensemble model achieved strong performance on the test set, with 89% Accuracy, 53% Precision, 90% Recall, an F1-score of 0.67, and an AUC of 0.89. This confirms the modelâ€™s ability to handle imbalanced data effectively while maintaining strong generalization.
In conclusion, the ensemble approach based on Decision Trees and dual sampling techniques outperformed individual models in predicting loan repayment. It highlights the potential of ensemble methods for robust predictions in real-world applications involving imbalanced data, such as credit risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer churn prediction.
One major limitation of the project was the lack of sufficient computational resources, which restricted experimentation with more complex models and advanced validation techniques such as stratified k-fold cross-validation. Future improvements could include the use of cloud-based infrastructure or distributed computing to overcome these constraints.
(All the statistical analisys were performed using KNIME.)
